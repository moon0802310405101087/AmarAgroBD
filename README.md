The Farm Inventory Management System AmarAgroBD is a smart and user-friendly platform created to help farm owners manage their products, customers, orders, and deliveries more easily and efficiently. This system is designed to support smooth communication between farm owners, customers, and delivery personnel while making the overall business process faster and more organized.
The system includes three main roles: Owner, Customer, and Delivery Man. The Owner is responsible for uploading products, managing stock, assigning orders to delivery men, and checking reports. Customers can view all products, place orders, and track delivery status. The Delivery Man can view assigned deliveries and confirm them once the order is placed successfully.
When a customer places an order, the system collects delivery details like address, phone number, and quantity. If the customer’s information already exists, it is used directly; otherwise, a new profile is created. This ensures that every order has the correct details and can be processed without error.
Once the order is placed, it is stored and shown on the Owner’s dashboard. The Owner then assigns the delivery to a delivery man by entering their email. After the product is delivered, the delivery man updates the order status to "Delivered", which helps the owner track successful deliveries.
From a technical side, the system follows proper functional requirements by providing features like product upload, customer ordering, delivery confirmation, and viewing reports. All features are designed with simple, clean interfaces to ensure an easy user experience for all users.
The system also supports important non-functional requirements such as:
•	Performance: Handles many users and orders at the same time.
•	Scalability: Can grow to support more users and farms in the future.
•	Security: Uses Firebase Authentication to keep user accounts safe.
•	Speed: Processes order creation and updates quickly, improving overall experience.
This system was developed using the Agile model, which helped us build it step by step. We gathered user feedback, created simple user stories, and used tools like Figma to design the interface. We also created diagrams like DFD, ERD, and followed the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to keep the code organized and easy to manage.
Overall, AmarAgroBD is a helpful and reliable tool for farmers to manage their business digitally. It improves order management, supports timely delivery, and ensures accurate sales records. With future updates and maintenance, this system can continue to support agriculture businesses across the country.
